# Facial-Emotion-Recognition-using-OpenCV-and-Deepface
This project implements real-time facial emotion detection using the `deepface` library and OpenCV. It captures video from the webcam, detects faces, and predicts the emotions associated with each face. The emotion labels are displayed on the frames in real-time.
## Dependencies

- [deepface](https://github.com/serengil/deepface): A deep learning facial analysis library that provides pre-trained models for facial emotion detection. It relies on TensorFlow for the underlying deep learning operations.
- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/): An open-source computer vision library used for image and video processing.
